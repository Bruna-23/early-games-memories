# Early Games Memories
## A quick trip about the games I played when I was young ðŸŽ®

This is a DIO challenge to create a repository where I can show what I learned about GitHub/Git, and I chose to relive some good old memories about videogames I played when I was a kid.

It's a simple and organized folder with some of my beloved PC games, where I had a MegaDrive/Genesis and SNES emulator and spent all my free hours playing every game, one by one. (There were over 100 of them ðŸ¤¯)

Here are a some articles that helped me to relive those memories:
