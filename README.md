# Early Games Memories
## A quick trip about the games I played when I was young ðŸŽ®

This is a DIO challenge to create a repository where I can show what I learned about GitHub/Git, and I chose to relive some good old memories about videogames I played when I was a kid.

It's a simple and organized folder with some of my beloved PC games, where I had a MegaDrive/Genesis emulator and spent all my free time playing every game, one by one. (There were over 100 of them ðŸ¤¯)

And when I was a little older, I started playing in other people's videogames, like PlayStation 1 and 2, whenever I had the chance. There was also a local store where I could pay R$3/hour (about $1 at the time) to play PlayStation 1 and 2.

When I was 19 years old, I finally got my own videogame with my own money, which was PlayStation 3, and since then I never stopped playing. So I bought the PlayStation 4 Gold Edition, and now I have the amazing PlayStation 5 with the DualSense controller that gives a much more imersive experience.

So I have a lot of lovely moments in my head where videogames were present, especially now that I have a wife that also LOVES videogames like me. ðŸ’™

Here are a some articles that helped me to relive those memories:
